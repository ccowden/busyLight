This project contains a simple Kotlin Android application that supports connecting to an HC-06 Bluetooth module. The HC-06 module is powered by an Arduino running a small script. The script listens for specific commands ('n' to turn on, 'f' to turn off) to control an LED.

TODO:
- Add schematic documents for circuit
- Add screen caps of Kotlin application
